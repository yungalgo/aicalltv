## Deploying to production

The [vite config](./vite.config.ts#L16-L17) is currently configured to use [Nitro v3](https://v3.nitro.build) (alpha) to deploy on Vercel, but can be easily switched to other providers.

Refer to the [TanStack Start hosting docs](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/hosting) for deploying to other platforms.

## Goodies

#### Scripts

We use **bun** by default, but you can modify these scripts in [package.json](./package.json) to use your preferred package manager.

- **`auth:generate`** - Regenerate the [auth db schema](./src/lib/db/schema/auth.schema.ts) if you've made changes to your Better Auth [config](./src/lib/auth/auth.ts).
- **`db`** - Run [drizzle-kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/kit-overview) commands. (e.g. `bun run db generate`, `bun run db studio`)
- **`ui`** - The shadcn/ui CLI. (e.g. `bun run ui add button`)
- **`format`**, **`lint`**, **`check-types`** - Run Prettier, ESLint, and check TypeScript types respectively.
  - **`check`** - Run all three above. (e.g. `bun run check`)
- **`deps`** - Selectively upgrade dependencies via taze.

#### Utilities

- [`auth/middleware.ts`](./src/lib/auth/middleware.ts) - Sample middleware for forcing authentication on server functions.
