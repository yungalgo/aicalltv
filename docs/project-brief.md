## Project Brief: Quadball Canada Registration and Events Website

### Project Overview

Quadball Canada needs a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for managing event registrations, player memberships, team profiles, and administrative tasks. This platform should simplify processes for players, teams, and admins, with customizable features and streamlined management.

### User Roles and Privileges

#### Organization Admins

- **Global Admins**: Full permissions across the entire platform, including creating and managing products, assigning user tags (coach, team lead, national team, standing team), editing player profiles (including suspensions), and customizing website appearance (colors, backgrounds).
- **Event Coordinators**: Admin privileges limited strictly to their specific event(s), such as editing rosters, managing payment statuses, and sending reminders.

#### Team Logins

- Team registration (annual membership).
- View and manage team members, assign coaches and team leads.
- Purchase memberships for players individually or allow players to register/pay independently.
- View player history, event participation, and edit jersey numbers.
- Generate custom reports limited to their own team members.

#### Individual Logins

- Create and manage personal profiles including:
  - Pronouns, pronunciation guide for names, jersey number (editable).
  - Gender, date of birth, emergency contact, demographic information.

- Register and pay for events and memberships.
- View registered events and payment history.

### Event Management Features

- Create event pages with:

- Detailed purchase reports including purchaser names and items bought.
- Customizable reporting feature allowing admins and team leads (limited to their teams) to create tailored reports based on specific data points (e.g., referee registrations, age-specific participation).
- Flexible export options allowing selection of specific data fields for event registration exports:
  - Basic pre-selection includes name, birthday, gender, and emergency contact information.
  - Advanced pre-selection includes all available data such as transaction ID, amount paid, membership status, and team registration.

### Integrations

- Social media feeds integrated directly into event or landing pages.
